## Notes

The example Godot project in this repository contains the final code that was modified in Lesson 32 of the Godot BootCamp. In this lesson, the example Godot project is updated to run a script on the brainCloud servers to submit a score to multiple leaderboards instead of just submitting a score to a single leaderboard.

Godot version: 4.2.1
