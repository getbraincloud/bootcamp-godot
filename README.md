cd bootcamp-godot
git checkout Lesson-18
```

## Notes

The example Godot project in this repository contains the final code that was modified in Lesson 19 of the Godot BootCamp. In this lesson, the example Godot project is updated to get the list of global entities using the Level indexed-id. The game's spawner then uses the global entity data to properly spawn asteroids and enemies with the desired ranged-values for the example game's horde mode.

Godot version: 4.2.1
